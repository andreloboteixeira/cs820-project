Total time of the experiment:0.00247851200401783


Truck started at node (0) with initial load of (0), and capacity of (20)

The algorithm used a threshold factor of (0.7)

The imported graph file name is 'graph'

The overall cost of the truck's path is: 11638.533
The list of paths is: 
[0, 8, 10]
[10, 8, 11, 5, 1]
[1, 5, 11, 9]
