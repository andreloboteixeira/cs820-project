# cs820-project
CS820 project repository. 

Let's not worry a lot now about folders structure because it can slow down things. Let's start using only the root of the repository(the one which has the helloword.cpp file). 

But the idea would be:
In the `graph-generator` folder goes the files related to create a `.txt`(or another) and save it in the `root` folder.

In the `graph-algorithms` folder goes the files related to read the saved graphs from the `.txt`(or another) at `root`, make the computations and save the results as a `.txt`(or another) in the root folder.
