# cs820-project
CS820 Artificial Intelligence Group Project repository.

The `graph-generator` folder contains the code related to roadmap graph generation, that involves saving the resulting graph in a formatted `.txt`file.

The `graph-algorithms` folder the code related to processing the graphs generated in the form of the `.txt' files. The algorithm(s) will read the graph structure, determine the best way to solve the shipping problem on it (i.e. maximizing and/or equalizing the amount of goods delivered + minimizing the overall costs of shipping), and then the results will be displayed to the console and/or saved to another '.txt' formatted file.

This is a WIP, new details will appear here soon.
